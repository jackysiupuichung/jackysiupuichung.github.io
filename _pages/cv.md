Education
======
* Ph.D in AI for Drug Discovery, Queen Mary University of London, Sept. 2023 - Present
  * Target identification and prioritisation using temporal text mining
  * Incorporate collaborative filtering to recommend novel therapeutic drug target
  * Learning target-disease mechanism of action through inductive logic programming and causal inference

* M.Sc. in Bioinformatics, Wageningen University and Research, Sept. 2020 - Sept. 2022
  * Prediction of gene expression from local regulatory sequence using transformer and attention
  * Devised DNABERT-reg, a transformer encoder model to investigate genomic sequential features that affect gene expression level
  * Implemented interpretability techniques like attention, integrated-gradient, and SHAP to infer biologically relevant DNA motifs

* B.Sc. in Biological science, University of Warwick, Sept.2017 - Sept. 2020

Work experience
======
* Feb. 2023 – Present: Junior Research Associate
  * Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom
  * Use deep learning for simulation of population genomics data to infer parameters of recent evolution of Anopheles populations, including temporal changes in population size and migration rate among different geographical locations
  * Software development and packaging of tools for publication
  * Participated in team meetings and contributed to research discussions across the department of biological and behavioural science

* Apr. 2022 – Sept. 2022: Bioinformatics Genetics Intern
  * Dummen Orange, De Lier, Netherlands
  * Created imputation framework for polyploidy plants, boosting resolution for genomics selection accuracy, and decreasing sequencing cost for variant identification
  * Performed high-throughput processing of multi-level genotype variant data
  * Packaged imputation tools into Docker for standardized executable components for company’s genotyping pipeline
