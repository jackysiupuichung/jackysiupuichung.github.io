Hey thanks for visiting my website! I am a 2nd year doctoral candidate at Queen Mary University of London, specialising in natural language processing (NLP) for AI and drug discovery, mainly focus on early stage target discovery, including target identification and prioritisation.

I am under the guidance of Arkaitz Zubiaga on the project: “Therapeutic target prioritisation with temporal text mining ” Additionally, I am jointly supervised by Claudia Cabrera, and Mani Mudaliar. My doctoral studies are funded by the UKRI Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (UKRI BBSRC), as a part of the AI for Drug Discovery Doctoral Training Programme (UKRI-AIDD), with an industrial partnership with Exscientia.

Beyond my academic research, I co-organize the DERI lunch and learn seminars in DERI. My broader research interests include understanding gene-disease associations and mechanisms for therpeutic purposes through language. My long term goal is to translate my research into accelerating actionable decision making for the drug discovery process.

Please feel free to reach out to me at pui.siu[AT]qmul.ac.uk.
