Hey thanks for visiting my website! I am a 2nd year doctoral candidate at Queen Mary University of London, specialising in natural language processing (NLP) for AI and drug discovery, mainly focus on early stage target discovery, including target identification and prioritisation.

I am under the guidance of Arkaitz Zubiaga on the project: “Therapeutic target prioritisation with temporal text mining ” Additionally, I am jointly supervised by Claudia Cabrera, and Mani Mudaliar. 

Beyond my academic research, I co-organize the DERI lunch and learn seminars in Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI). My broader research interests include understanding gene-disease associations and mechanisms for therpeutic purposes,
